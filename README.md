# BLOSUM62_Mutation_Impact_Prediction
This is a simple program that uses Blosum62 matrix to assign scores on a mutation.
This program reads a vep file that contains mutations and a file containing the BLOSUM62 matrix and produces the scores of each mutation in an output TSV file.
Run though the command line:

`python blosum_mip.py Path_VEP_file.tsv Path_blosum62.txt -o path_output.tsv`

  **DISCLAIMER**:  This simple project was conducted during my studies at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. And much of the code was provided by the study program of the MSc Bioinformatics and Systems Biology.
  Only parts of the program were filled in by me!
